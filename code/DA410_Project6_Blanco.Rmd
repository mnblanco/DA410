Do a principle component analysis of the data in Table 3.6 (page 79)

Use R to solve this part (built-in function). 

Make sure you include the commands and outputs, as well as the interpretations of the outputs.

```{r echo=FALSE}
probe <- probe[, 2:6]

probe.scaled <- scale(probe, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
#Correlation matrix
pcacor <- cor(probe.scaled)
res.eig <- eigen(pcacor)
```

```{r}
# apply PCA
probe.pca <- prcomp(probe,
                    center = TRUE,
                    scale. = TRUE) 
probe.pca
res.eig
```

The first PC was weakly negative correlated with variable y3, y4, y2, y1 and y5.

The second PC was strongly correlated with variables y5 (negative) and weakly correlated with variable y2, y4, y3 (negative), y4 and y1.


```{r}
probe.pca.summary <- summary(probe.pca)
probe.pca.summary
```

The result contain 5 principal components (PC1-5). Each of these explains a percentage of the total variation in the dataset. PC1 explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[2,1] * 100, 1)`% of the total variance, which means that nearly two-thirds of the information in the dataset (5 variables) can be encapsulated by just that one Principal Component. PC2 explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[2,2] * 100, 1)`% of the variance. PC3 explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[2,3] * 100, 1)`% of the variance.  PC4 explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[2,4] * 100, 1)`% of the variance. PC5 explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[2,5] * 100, 1)`% of the variance.  PC1 and PC2 can explain explains `r round(summary(probe.pca)$importance[3,2] * 100, 1)`% of the variance. Based on this it, we can forget about PC3 through PC5.


The sum of the eigenvalues from a correlation matrix will equal the number of variables.  The sum of the eigenvalues will equal 5.  

The first principal component accounts for the most variable variance (`r probe.pca.summary$importance[2,1]` / `r sum(probe.pca.summary$importance[2,])` = `r round(res.eig$values[1] / sum(res.eig$values) * 100, 1)`%) with the remaining components in lesser and lesser amounts.  

Only PC1 contains SS loadings > 1 (Kaiser’s criterion).


The first two principal components are:

$Z_l$ = `r res.eig$vectors[1,1]` $y_1$ + `r res.eig$vectors[2,1]` $y_2$ + `r res.eig$vectors[3,1]` $y_3$ + `r res.eig$vectors[4,1]` $y_4$ + `r res.eig$vectors[5,1]` $y_5$

$Z_2$ = `r res.eig$vectors[1,2]` $y_1$ + `r res.eig$vectors[2,2]` $y_2$ + `r res.eig$vectors[3,2]` $y_3$ + `r res.eig$vectors[4,2]` $y_4$ + `r res.eig$vectors[5,2]` $y_5$

There are 5 components with descending eigenvalues (`r res.eig$values`).  The sum of these eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the variable variances in the variance-covariance matrix (S).   The sum of the eigenvalues for the five principal components is `r sum(res.eig$values)`, which is referred to as the trace of a matrix.  The sum of the variable variances indicates the total amount of variance that is available to be partitioned across the 5 principal components.   

Decide how many components to retain. Show your reason.

For the probe data set, I recomend to retain 2 components 

### Method 1: % of variance

An appropriate threshold percentage should be selected prior to starting the process.  If we want to explain at least 70% of variance then we would select PC1 and PC2.

### Method 2: Kaiser’s criterion

Components with SS loadings > 1. In the probe data, retaining only PC1 is recomended. The SS loading for PC2 is < 1.  Retaining PC2 is not recomended.

### Method 3: Scree plot

The number of points after point of inflexion. For this plot, retaining PC1 and PC2 is recomended.

```{r}
fviz_eig(probe.pca, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 80))
```

The scree plot suggest to keep 2 principal components.

### Method 4: Significance of the "larger" components

Test $H_{ok}$: $\gamma_{p-k+1}$ = ... = $\gamma_p$ using a likelihood ratio approach.  Reject $H_0$ if $u \ge \chi^2_{\alpha,v}$

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- ncol(probe)
n <- nrow(probe)
df <- u <- x <- vector("numeric", p)

for (k in p:2) {
  i <- p - k + 1
  df[i] <- v <- ((k-1) * (k+2))/2
  
  average_eigenvalue <- sum(res.eig$values[i:p]) / k
  
  u[i] <- (n - ((2 * p + 11) / 6)) * (k * log(average_eigenvalue) -  sum(log(res.eig$values[i:p])))  
  x[i] <- qchisq(.95, df=v)
}
(dmat <- cbind(Eigenvalue = res.eig$values, k = p:1, u = u, df = df, "Crit Value" = x))
```

$H_{02}$: $\gamma_{p-1}$ = $\gamma_{p}$   $\gamma_4$ = $\gamma_5$ Reject null hypothesis since $u \ge \chi^2_{\alpha,v}$

$H_{03}$: $\gamma_{p-2}$ = $\gamma_{p-1}$   $\gamma_3$ = $\gamma_2$ Fail to reject null hypothesis since $u < \chi^2_{\alpha,v}$

The tests indicate that only the last four (population) eigenvalues are equal and we should retain PC1

Method 1, 2, and 4 recomend that only PC1 is retained.  I would only include PC2 if the minimum explained variance % is selected to be at least 80%. Selecting PC3 should be avoided as it explain 92% and this could indicate possible overfitting.  None of the methods recomended PC3-PC5 to be retained. 

```{r include=FALSE}
ggbiplot(probe.pca, obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1, 
         ellipse = TRUE, 
         circle = TRUE) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = '') +
  theme(legend.direction = 'horizontal', 
        legend.position = 'top')
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
fviz_pca_var(probe.pca,
             col.var = "contrib", # Color by contributions to the PC
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE     # Avoid text overlapping
)
```

```{r}
fviz_pca_ind(probe.pca,
             col.ind = "cos2", # Color by the quality of representation
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE     # Avoid text overlapping
             )
```

Individuals with a similar profile are grouped together.

```{r echo=FALSE}
pcmodel = principal(pcacor, nfactors=5, rotate="none", scores = TRUE)   # 5 components 
pcmodel
summary(pcmodel)

#http://geog.uoregon.edu/bartlein/courses/geog490/week09-PCA.html
#qg_pca <- qgraph(pcmodel) #, layout="spring", posCol="darkgreen", negCol="darkmagenta", arrows=FALSE, edge.width=2, add=FALSE)
#qgraph(qg_pca_rot, layout="spring", posCol="darkgreen", negCol="darkmagenta", arrows=FALSE, edge.width=2)

alpha(pcacor)
fa.diagram(pcmodel)
```

A component will summarize the five variable relations and yield 76% of the variable variance.  The principal component equation to generate the scores is computed using the first set of weights.

First two principal components for the probe data

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot(as.matrix(probe.scaled) %*% res.eig$vectors[,1:2], xlab = "z1", ylab = "z2")
fa.parallel(probe.scaled, n.obs = nrow(probe.scaled), fm = "pa", fa = "pc")
```

From this plot, we can see that the first component has the largest eigen value.

## Check assumptions

The KMO test

```{r echo=FALSE}
paf.pca = rela::paf(as.matrix(probe.scaled), eigcrit=1, convcrit=.001)
kmo <- summary(paf.pca)
kmo
```

The KMO test is close to 1 (KMO = `r kmo$KMO`), so we would conclude that n = `r nrow(probe)` with 5 variables is an adequate sample size.   Bartlett = `r kmo$Bartlett`), but requires another function to test for significance.

Test significance of the Bartlett test using correlation matrix

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
bartlett <- cortest.bartlett(probe.scaled, n = 11)
bartlett
```

The Bartlett chi-square = `r bartlett$chisq`, df = `r bartlett$df`, p = `r bartlett$p.value` is significant indicating correlations in matrix are significant.

```{r echo=FALSE}
det(pcacor)
```

The determinant is positive. The three assumptions for conducting a principal components analysis have been met.
